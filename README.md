# 1st-Party-Cookie-URL-Param-Getter
1st-Party-Cookie-URL-Param-Getter is a Google Tag Manager (GTM) Variable Template designed to fetch values from 1st-party cookies or from specific URL parameters. It is particularly useful for tracking user attribution across major advertising platforms such as Google Ads, Facebook Ads, TikTok Ads, and others.

Key Features:
✅ Cookie Reader:
Retrieves values from specific 1st-party cookies.

✅ URL Parameter Reader:
Extracts values from URL parameters (e.g., gclid, fbclid, ttclid, etc.).

✅ Fallback Logic:
If the value is not found in the URL, it can fall back to a stored value in cookies.

✅ Cross-Platform Attribution Support:
Designed to help track click IDs and attribution parameters across Google Ads, Facebook, TikTok, and similar platforms.

Usage Example:
If you want to capture the gclid or fbclid from the URL and store it in a cookie to send it later with a conversion event or a GTM tag, this Variable Template makes it easy to do so.

Why Use This Template?
Enhanced Attribution: Accurately identify the traffic source of users across platforms.

DataLayer Enrichment: Push cookie or URL parameter values into the Data Layer.

Accurate Conversion Tracking: Include source, medium, and click IDs in your conversion events for better ad performance analysis.
